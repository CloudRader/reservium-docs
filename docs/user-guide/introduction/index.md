## What is the difference between Users and Managers?

Reservium distinguishes between two roles: *User* and *Manager*.

Managers have extended capabilities, such as access to the Manager Panel and the ability to perform additional operations related to reservations.
They also carry extra responsibilities, including managing services and calendar access, as well as configuring related rules and settings.
