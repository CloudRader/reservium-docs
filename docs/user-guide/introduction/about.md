# What is Reservium?

**Reservium is an open source reservation system designed for booking open spaces in an organization.**

Reservium helps organizations manage reservations for shared spaces, such as rooms, work areas, or other facilities. It provides an interface to view availability, create reservations, and apply rules that define how and when spaces can be booked.

In short, it allows users to reserve public or private spaces according to defined constraints, such as access permissions, booking windows, participant limits, or collision checks. Reservations may be confirmed automatically or require approval depending on the room rules, and users receive notifications about the status of their bookings.

Managers have additional capabilities. They can configure reservation rules, approve, edit or decline reservations, manage services and rooms they are responsible for, and perform administrative tasks through the manager panel.

Reservium supports integration with organization-wide systems such as Single Sign-On (SSO) via Keycloak, email notifications, and Google Calendar. Future development includes support for access control systems and more advanced permission and multi-tenant features.
