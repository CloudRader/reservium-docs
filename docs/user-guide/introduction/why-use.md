# Why Use a Reservium?

A reservation system is essential for organizing shared spaces efficiently and reducing administrative overhead. By adopting Reservium, organizations can replace manual booking methods—such as email threads, spreadsheets, or in-person coordination—with a structured, transparent, and consistent process.

It helps prevent double-bookings, ensures that access rules are followed, and reduces errors caused by manual communication. Users can clearly see availability, understand reservation conditions, and receive timely updates without relying on room managers for every detail.

For managers, Reservium simplifies oversight. Approval workflows, reservation limits, and service-specific rules help maintain order without constant manual checking. It also streamlines onboarding and role changes, ensuring that users automatically receive the correct access based on their permissions.

Centralizing reservations eliminates lost information, improves accountability, and gives both users and managers a reliable overview of space usage. This leads to better planning, fewer conflicts, and a more predictable and organized environment.
